## Technologies we used

In this project we have used the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- Express
- Mongoose

We have created this Hotstar website clone by using media queries which makes our project responsive.
Our Main motive of cloning the Hotstar.com was that to create proper functionality and its designing like:
  -Backend - which was very helpful to manage lot of data and routes.
  -React - which helped us to build frontend such as designing and structure of website.
  -Hover Effects - styling all the buttons, images etc


CONCLUSION:
It is our first project where we have to clone a website using react and it was very challenging but as a team we are very helping so if someone stuck the others are helping the one who stuck to figure out the solution.
So, this was all from our side and we are delighted to work on similar kind of projects in future as well.
