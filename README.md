Project Clone: https://hotstar.com

We have created the clone of the Hotstar.com

Deployment Link: https://

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project:-
In this project We have tried to make a look alike clone of Hotstar a video streaming Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned in Masai School, we were able to clone the front end and backend as well.

## Technologies we used

In this project we have used the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node
- Express
- Mongoose

We have created this Hotstar website clone by using media queries which makes our project responsive.
Our Main motive of cloning the Hotstar.com was that to create proper functionality and its designing like:
  -Backend - which was very helpful to manage lot of data and routes.
  -React - which helped us to build frontend such as designing and structure of website.
  -Hover Effects - styling all the buttons, images etc


CONCLUSION:
It is our first project where we have to clone a website using react and it was very challenging but as a team we are very helping so if someone stuck the others are helping the one who stuck to figure out the solution.
So, this was all from our side and we are delighted to work on similar kind of projects in future as well.
